# It's up to You

We've all heard these:

- Meditate
- Do a couple of push ups every day
- Walk, run, lift weights
- Eat only meat / don't eat meat
- Forget objectives, focus on [my] "systems"

All these might be "good" things, no question. **But good for _what_?**

We read some tweet of some guy we admire and then decided that we should follow what he did, and then we'll achieve what he achieved. The thing is... there are too many details to copy.

Take, for example, Tiger Wood's swing. Watch it in slow motion. Try your best to imitate him. Have him coach you all day every day for years. You won't get it. Ask him how he does it... not even he knows. Sure, he'll throw at you some tips and tricks just to say something... but really, he doesn't have a clue.

So what do you do? You aim. You focus on your objectives, understand your destination vividly, and let your brain work. It's up to you, and only up to you.

It's not that you can't get it if you follow coaching, tips amd tricks, hacks, how-to's; it's just less efficient, and therefore lowers your chances of success.

> Coaches and teachers will only delay a focused mind.

In the era of information: constant productivity hacks, dozens of apps and "tools", a sea of self-help books: trust yourself. Aim, and proceed.
