# Why Capitalism always wins

It's quite simple, actually. Humans act on incentives (all living things do, but we only care about human ones), and capitalism is the system that aligns those perfectly. There really aren't any systems more efficient than capitalism because no other system understands human incentives the way capitalism does. Let's take a look.

# Comunism

In summary, comunism says, "We want everyone to be equally rich (or poor), no matter if some create more wealth than others." It basically removes the economic incentive for creating wealth. 

- The ones that create wealth are now less motivated to create
- The ones that don't create wealth and still have access to it, well, why would they start creating?

The only option that's left is forcing people to work, and that's where comunist experiments usually (not to say always) end up.

> "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest." - Adam Smith

Of course. People create wealth for themselves (and for their close relationships). Like it or not, we are like that. This is the fact that comunism blindly and naively ignores.

# Socialism

Socialism is basically a more diluted form of communism. They practice it through high taxes instead of complete expropiation, but the concept is the same. They want everyone to be equally rich. Cute.

Socialists are usually good people that don't really think it through, and by default they land on socialism. It's an attractive idea: we could all be equally rich! Sadly, it ends the same way: 

- How can we all be equally rich? Taking from the rich<i>-er</i> and giving to the poor<i>-er</i>
- The rich, seeing that they can't fully enjoy the fruits of their work, are less incentivized to create
- The poor, being able to get by without working, why would they create?

I take the extremes (the rich and the poor) but you can imagine that in the middle the same thing happens. If a man can be assured a standard without working, he'll tend to create less. If, no matter how hard he works, he lands on the same standard, he'll tend to create less aswell.

All these micro deincentivizations compound, and they result in misery.

# And all other systems?

Other systems, the ones that land in the "middle", take some things from capitalism and others from comunism and socialism. They are better than plain comunism, yes, but they are worse than pure capitalism. They always are, because there's always some incentive that is lost.

With every political-economical decision that your government does, ask yourself: How does this policy affect incentives? Will people want to create more because of this? If the answer is "no", then it's bad policy.

# The Beauty Of Capitalism

If you think about it, every law in a pure capitalist system is made to improve incentives. 

- "You'll get to keep what you make"
- "We'll keep you safe from criminals, so you can focus on being more prosperous"

Yes please.

# Arguments Against?

The root of most of the arguments against capitalism is the fallacy of thinking that wealth is a zero-sum game. That if someone is rich, it means some other fellow is poor. If you assume that, then there's a case for more socialist systems. After all, no one creates wealth, but only takes it away from someone.

Fortunately, this is not true. Wealth is created, not taken. So lets create and exchange!
