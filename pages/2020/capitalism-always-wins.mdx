# Why Capitalism always wins

It's quite simple, actually. Humans act on incentives (all living things do, but we only care about human ones), and Capitalism is a system that align those perfectly. There are no systems more efficient than Capitalism, because no other system understands human incentives. Let's take a look.

## Comunism

In summary, Comunism says, "We want everyone to be equally rich (or poor!), no matter if some create more wealth than others." It basically removes the economic incentive for creating wealth. 

- The ones that create wealth now are less motivated to create
- The ones that don't create wealth and still have access to it, well, why would they start creating?

The only option that's left is forcing people to work, and that's where Comunist experiments usually (not to say always) end up.

> It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.

Of course. People create wealth for themselves (and for their families!). Like it or not, we are like that. This is the fact that Comunism blindly and naively ignores.

## Socialism

Socialism is basically a more diluted form of communism. They practice it through high taxes instead of complete expropiation, but the concept is the same. They want everyone to be equally rich. Oh, that's nice.

Socialists are usually good people that don't really think it through, and by default they land on socialism. It's an attractive idea: we could all be equally rich! Sadly, it ends the same way: 

- How can we all be equally rich? Taking from the rich<i>-er</i> and giving to the poor<i>-er</i>
- The rich, seeing that they can't fully enjoy the fruits of their work, are less incentivized to create
- The poor, being able to get by without working, why would they create?

I take the extremes (the rich and the poor) but you can imagine that in the middle the same thing happens. If a man can be assured a standard without working, he'll tend to create less. If no matter how hard he works, he lands on the same standard, he'll tend to create less aswell.

## Keynesianism

Keynesianism, in a way, tries to be a mix between capitalism and socialism. It bases itself on the idea that "The Market" is good, but it has flaws. To solve this, a big welfare state.

# And back to Capitalism

Capitalism proposes one simple rule: what you create you can keep. What is yours will be protected. And that's it. This way people want to create wealth, because they get to keep it. More even, they "compete" against each other to be best creators of value and wealth. This is incentives aligned perfectly.

"And if you don't like competition?" Don't worry, you don't <i>have</i> to compete! If you want, you can live with what you create yourself. Wealth is not a zero-sum game. If it was, we could not grow in population and still be more prosperous every day!
